Add a Table of Contents with internal anchor links, built automatically from header tags.

== Description ==
Generate a table of contents based on header tags within the post. Outputs an indented list of anchor links at the top of each page or post linking to the relevant header tag.

Tabe of Contents does not require any configuration. On page or post loading, the content is examined for header tags that can be used to generate a ToC. If the header tag does not have an ID attribute one will be added for the purposes of linking, otherwise the existing ID tag will be used.
